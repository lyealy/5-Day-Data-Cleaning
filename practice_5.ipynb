In general, a string is considered \"closer\" to another one the fewer characters you'd need to change if you were transforming one string into another. So \"apple\" and \"snapple\" are two changes away from each other (add \"s\" and \"n\") while \"in\" and \"on\" and one change away (rplace \"i\" with \"o\"). You won't always be able to rely on fuzzy matching 100%, but it will usually end up saving you at least a little time.\n",
